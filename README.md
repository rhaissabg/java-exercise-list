# Java Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Java programming exercises that I completed as part of my study and practice routine using **Eclipse IDE** and **Java 21**. The exercises increase in difficulty according to my evolving knowledge of Java, helping me revisit important concepts and learn new ones.

## About

The exercises focus on fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch-case`)
- Exception handling (`try-catch`)
- Input/output operations
- Basic arithmetic and logical operations
- Working with arrays and primitive data types
- Date and time manipulation using `LocalDate` and `Period`

Each exercise is implemented in a clear and structured way to reinforce coding best practices and problem-solving skills.

## Topics Covered

Some examples of the exercises include:

- Calculating net salary with tax deductions
- Converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Generating multiplication tables with dynamic ranges
- Validating and classifying triangles by their side lengths
- Calculating fuel consumption based on travel time and speed
- Swapping variable values and performing integer division with quotient and remainder
- Calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) and classifying the result
- Calculating life time in years, months, and days from a birth date
- Handling user input validation and error handling

## Motivation

These exercises were sourced from a curated list available at [DIO - Programming Logic Exercises](https://www.dio.me/articles/lista-de-exercicios-para-treinar-logica-de-programacao) and were completed following the study guide provided by Dev Magro (@devmagro on X). 

This structured list helped me systematically revisit foundational Java programming concepts, gain hands-on experience writing clean, efficient code, improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, and learn practical Java features like exception handling and the date/time API.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of the exercises or Java programming in general!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
